            <p class="font-italic"> Purpose: Making lots of purchases of second hand stuff around a city, in an efficient way.
                What’s the problem: When making many purchases second hand, it may be cheaper but you’ll be travelling through all of the city. But with a group of people furnishing a place together, for example when refugees code finds a new headquarter, it would allow a group to look for nice offers together.<br>

                User Stories:<br>

                As a buyer, I want to add something to a city map.<br>
                As a seller I want one person to talk to.<br>
                As a user I need to see where in the city I live and where the action is.<br>
                As a group of people I want to have an overview of what products are being looked at, what can be purchased, and how much money is still available.<br>
                As an organisation I want to democratically furnish a place.<br>
